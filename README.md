# The RSA Problem using Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains all the necessary code and data for our CS258 final project, organized into specific directories:

### Report

The overleaf project files of the final report can be found within the 'paper' folder.

### Environment files

The custom gymnasium environments created for Case 1 and Case 2 are stored in the 'environment_files' directory.

### Code files

1. PPO:
The code necessary to run Case 1 and Case 2 using the PPO algorithm is located in the 'PPO_code_files' directory.

2. IMPALA:
The code necessary to run Case 1 and Case 2 using the IMPALA algorithm is stored in the 'IMPALA_code_files' directory.

3. Simple Heuristic:
A single code file that runs both Case 1 and Case 2 using a straightforward heuristic approach is available in the 'simple_heuristic_code_files' directory.

### Raw data files

The raw data to plot all the graphs given in the report is present in the 'data' directory:

- Inside, there are three subdirectories corresponding to each algorithm: 'impala-results', 'ppo-results', and 'simple-heuristic-results'.
- Each algorithm directory contains two subdirectories for Case 1 and Case 2.
- Within each case subdirectory, the file named 'utils_{algo_name}_{case_number}.csv' contains raw data on average network utilization per episode. This data was used for plotting graphs in Section 3B of the report.
- Additionally, in the 'impala' and 'PPO' case folders, there are two other subdirectories with results files generated by Ray, which are used for plotting the learning curve graphs detailed in Section 3A of the report.
